# superstore-bi-report
A sample power BI project analyzing sales, product performance and shipping ops using modified superstore dataset.

## Project Overview
This repository showcases an end-to-end Business Intelligence report project using the Superstore dataset. The project was designed to demonstrate knowledge in advanced data modeling, DAX measures (including time intelligence), Row Level Security and interactive reporting capabilities (eg. Drill Through) in Power BI.

## Key Features & Insights
- **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs with YoY comparisons, segment-wise revenue and profit breakdown, and 5-year performance trends.
- **Sales Performance**: Regional and customer-level revenue analysis with drill-through to category and/ or market-level insights.
- **Product Analysis**: Profit trends by category and product-level revenue. Can be filtered by category and subcategory using slicers. User can drill through to view order level details.
- **Shipping & Operations**: Evaluation of shipping cost vs. profit by mode; strategic insights into cost-effective logistics.
- **Order level drill through**: Interactive table for detailed order-level analysis with filters and drill-through capabilities.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- 
- **Data Modeling**: Star schema design, relationships, and data transformation using Power Query (eg. Merge Query, Column Profiling etc.)
- **DAX Measures**:
  - Time Intelligence: YTD, YoY%
  - Context filter manipulation
- **Interactive Reporting**:
  - Drill-through pages and conditional navigation buttons
  - Slicers and tooltips for enhanced UX
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
  - Role-based access for regional leaders
- **Visual Design Best Practices**:
  - Clean layout, minimal tabs, consistent color scheme
  - KPI cards, matrix tables, scatter plots etc.
- **Data Storytelling**:
  - Executive summary with actionable insights
  - Clear narrative flow from overview to granular detail

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, visualization)
- Excel (Data preparation)
- Superstore dataset (modified)
